# Day 01: Just Another Bar Code

Given was the following image:
![HV18_Ball_Day1_color.png](01/HV18_Ball_Day1_color.png)

I nearly gave up on this challenge until I finally stopped ignoring the text:
"Just Another Bar Code" `->` JAB-Code.

As it turns out the image can simply be uploaded to:
[https://jabcode.org/scan](https://jabcode.org/scan).

Result: `HV18-L3ts-5t4r-7Th3-Phun-G33k`
