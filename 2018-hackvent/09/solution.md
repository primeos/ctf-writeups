# Day 09: fake xmass balls

## Challenge text

```
A rogue manufacturer is flooding the market with counterfeit yellow xmas
balls.They are popping up like everywhere!

Can you tell them apart from the real ones? Perhaps there is some useful
information hidden in the fakes...
```

## Solution

Via GIMP it was easy to to extract a code by subtracting one PNG from the other.

![medium_64.png](09/medium_64.png)
![medium-64.png](09/medium-64.png)

![code.png](09/code.png)

However I didn't manage to decode that code, some ideas:

- Binary -> ASCII
- Morse code
- QR code, barcode, etc.
