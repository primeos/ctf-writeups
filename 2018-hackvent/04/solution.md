# Day 04: pirating like in the 90ies

Ahoy, my name is Santa and I want to be a pirate!

I had no idea and gave up eventually... :o

But I later found some hints in the chat :) #YAY

With the hints "Monkey Island" and "Copyright protection" I finally found this

Which eventually gave me the flag: `HV18-5o9x-4geL-7hkJ-wc4A-xp8F`.
