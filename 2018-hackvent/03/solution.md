# Day 03: Catch me

... if you can.
To get the flag, just press the button:
[Catch me!](https://hackvent.hacking-lab.com/C4tchM3_dizzle/)

This was probably the easiest challenge :)

I've looked at the source code and found `var _0x766f`:

In that form (hexadecimal byte encoding) it obviously wasn't readable yet but I
could simply use the developer console to view the "decoded" values by typing
`_0x766f`:

```
0: "Good trick!This was a little bit too easy, wasn't it? So try another method to get the flag."
1: "Congratulations!You got the flag: HV18-pFAT-O1Dl-HjVp-jJNE-Zju8"
2: "click"
3: "#button"
4: "width"
5: "height"
6: "outerWidth"
7: "outerHeight"
8: "resize"
9: "which"
10: "preventDefault"
11: "keydown"
12: "mouseenter"
13: "pageX"
14: "pageY"
15: "addEventListener"
16: "mousemove"
17: "mouseover"
18: "random"
19: "scale"
20: "middle"
21: "display"
22: "none"
23: "css"
24: "hide"
25: "left"
26: "top"
27: "block"
28: "show"
29: "ready"
length: 30
__proto__: Array(0)
```

Which revealed the flag: HV18-pFAT-O1Dl-HjVp-jJNE-Zju8
