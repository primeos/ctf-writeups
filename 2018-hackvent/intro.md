# HACKvent 2018

This was the first public (there was a private one at my university) CTF
competition I've ever participated in, so I didn't expect to be able to solve
many challenges (maybe a few easy ones) but it went way better than expected.
The main limiting factor for me was time, which is probably almost always the
case, and this obviously depends on experience and skill.
The [Hacking-Lab chat](https://www.hacking-lab.com/chat/) was pretty helpful at
the beginning, which is probably the reason why I didn't quit at the beginning.
